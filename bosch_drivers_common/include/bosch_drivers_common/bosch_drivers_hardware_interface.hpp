   * This abstract class provides the generic format so that devices
   * and drivers can communicate over different physical hardware
   * adapters. For example, if gumstix, Sub20, and Arduino all derive from
   * this class, then a single sensor driver can be written independently of all.
   * Concrete implementations of this class provide the actual commands to read
   * and write from the specific hardware interface.
   * Since most interfaces are 8-bit, we use the 8-bit byte as the fundamental
   * unit or size. Commands ask for data in number of bytes.
