/**
 * \brief Driver to use a motor encoder on a supported serial device.
 *
 * This class enables the user to create an instance of an encoder on the
 * connected serial device itself. The device will keep track of the encoder value
 * using external interrupts if available on the selected pin. To contruct the
 * encoder object the user needs to define two pins to be used by the device.
 * These pins will automatically enable the internal pullup resistor and expect
 * the connected encoder to pull the input to ground or drive in both directions.
 * It is highly recommended to use a pin with external interrupt support at least
 * for encoder1_pin. If not, the encoder object will need to be polled frequently
 * to detect any changes.
 * See http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Encoder.html for more information
